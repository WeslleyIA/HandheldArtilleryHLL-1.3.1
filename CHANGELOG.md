Release Notes - v1.3.1
Here's what I changed:
File Size (.opk): I resolved the critical issue with the file size. I moved all of the map images out of the local package and now load them from a GitHub repository via the jsDelivr CDN. The .opk size should be much smaller now.
Ad Clicks: The other critical issue, with ads opening in the Overwolf browser, has also been resolved. They should now open correctly in the user's default browser.
Hotkey Label Color: I fixed the readability bug on the settings screen.
